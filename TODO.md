# TODO
- vardecl. DONE.
- assign. DONE.
- RETURNS. DONE.
- make function parsing to the end. DONE.
- afterwards we can actually patch everything sort of together. DONE.
- then after it we go for ifs and whiles. SKIPPED
- then after it we parse types and do arrays. SKIPPED
- then after it we parse member exprs for structs. SKIPPED
- well loooks like frontend is ready, nice! NOT REALLY
- go on to make fucking ast translator, boyo, your duty is not yet over. ON THIS
- well, we shall start with refactoring a bit of ir. id and cmp have to fucking go.
- well, afterwards we also should go for adding custom types.
- so, that's quite nice. now we go onto actually translating stuff.
- start with simple types of exprs. literals and stuff like that, assigns, decls, everything's quite easy here.
- then we go onto translating ifs. ifs are quite nice to translate, although quite hard(tbh hardest one esp. from simpler ones).
- and after all this we translate whiles. big milestone here to check that everything so far works as expected and nice.
- afterwards we start the second big boss in the translator subdirectory, we go onto GEPs and stores and loads.
- well. if you're actually alive after all'at and you actually did it in reasonable timeframe, im honestly so happy for you.
- and yeah. go onto making actually good codegen. work is never fucking done.
