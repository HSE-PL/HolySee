Individual goals
Vova:
First milestone:

- Plan backend IR.
- Make simple codegen (should compile simple IR samples)
- Fibonacci (both recursive ans loops-based)

Second milestone:
TODO: change it.
- write translator from ast to ir

Third milestone:
- Simple optimizations

Egor:
First milestone:

    Research his (novel) idea of allocator and implement it
    Research and establish APIs for GC and allocator
    Dummy implementation of GC/allocator

Second milestone:

    GC is integrated, actually works and collects something

Third milestone:

    GC traces and doesn't leak, infinite loops that allocate should not terminate
